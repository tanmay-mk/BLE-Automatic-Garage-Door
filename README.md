# ECEN5823-Course Project

This project was created for academic purposes to comply with the course project requirements of the course CU-ECEN5823 - Internet of Things Embedded Firmware.  
  
For the course project, I chose option 1, which is to implement a Bluetooth GATT server using a custom GATT service along with one or more sensor and EFR Connect app.
